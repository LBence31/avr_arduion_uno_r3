# AVR Arduino Uno R3 Programming

_Learning the basics of embedded programming with AVR on an Arduino Uno R3 which has an ATmega328P microcontroller_

The projects are from the "Projects Book" from the Arduino Starter Kit.
There is also a picture for each project describing the circuit. If there isn't one, then no circuit is needed, as in `01_Blink` project, which simply blinks the onboard LED.

I'm not using the Arduino IDE to implement the code; instead I'm using "pure C" to write code for the hardware. I'm still using the Arduino bootloader because the main reason for this repo/project is to explore embedded programming with only the basics.

## Workflow

I'm working on Fedora Linux (via WSL) and here are the packages and programs I'm using for my "pure C" workflow:

- avr-gcc - compiler for the AVR microcontrollers
- avr-libc - standard C library for AVR
- avrdude - flash/uploader to talk to the bootloader (or programmer)
- make - to simplify the build process
- screen - for serial monitoring, aka debug
- [usbipd-win tool](https://github.com/dorssel/usbipd-win/releases) - installed on windows to share the board connected via USB to WSL2
- vim (btw)
